## Tagging / Release Guidelines
Releases are named with [Semantic Versioning](https://devconnected.com/how-to-create-git-tags/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20create%20a,that%20you%20want%20to%20create.&text=As%20an%20example%2C%20let's%20say,command%20and%20specify%20the%20tagname)

That means following features may change with each Verison:
* **major** : is a version number where you introduced breaking modifications (modifications of your new version are NOT compatible with previous versions);
* **minor** : is a version number that is compatible with previous versions;
* **patch** : is an increment for a bug fix or a patch fix done on your software.

Following is the Structure of a release name: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` for example: `v1.0.0` or `v2.2.1`
